### 2. WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES TO

a. What Is This Privacy Policy?

This Privacy Policy explains how PopTalk will handle and safeguard your personal information, and the choices you have to access and control your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to: personal information you provide us when you use the PopTalk Messenger app (“PopTalk App”), optional services made available within the PopTalk App, and other apps that integrate with or work in conjunction with the PopTalk App (collectively “Apps”); personal information you provide us when you visit websites maintained by us relating to our Apps (“Websites”) (Apps and Websites are collectively referred to as the “Service”); and personal information about you provided by users of the Service.

b. What Privacy Policy Applies to Other PopTalk Services?

Users may request additional services from PopTalk or PopTalk affiliates. Because the needs and choices of each user vary, we provide separate privacy policies or addendums to this Privacy Policy for certain additional services. The separate privacy policies and addendums explain the types of information we collect, their purposes of use, and other policies that may apply to that service. When you choose to use an additional service, you will be informed of the applicable privacy policy or addendum, which applies in addition to and may modify this Privacy Policy, before you can access the additional service. Please note that, you can check your applicable privacy policy or addendum within the Apps that you are using or Websites you are visiting.

+ to verify your identity;

+ to allow you to use your PopTalk account on multiple devices and transfer your PopTalk account to another device;

+ to help you find people you know that already are PopTalk users so that you can connect using PopTalk; and, upon your request, to allow other PopTalk users to connect with you;

> i. Website Visitors

Like most website operators, PopTalk collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor requests. PopTalk's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how PopTalk's visitors use its website. From time to time, PopTalk may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

PopTalk also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and email addresses for users who post feedback or report an issue on the Website.

> ii. PopTalk Software Users

When you install PopTalk Software on your mobile device, you are required to provide a mobile phone number to receive access code via SMS. The phone number will be saved in PopTalk servers. The phone number is also used to discover other PopTalk users who have your phone number in their address book.

You need to permit PopTalk to access your address book in the mobile device. A simplified copy of the address book with information of name, phone number, ringtone of each contact will be stored in PopTalk servers. The phone numbers and name of your contacts are used to build your PopTalk friend list.

PopTalk also collects information such as the mobile device ID, device name, OS type and version, and IP address to make certain PopTalk functions work.

PopTalk does not disclose, release your phone number, contacts information, or device information to any third parties.

Certain PopTalk features require access to the location information for your mobile phone. 

When you use PopTalk to send a multimedia message (such as sharing a picture, or sharing a video clip), the multimedia content will be cached in PopTalk servers for increased performance. The cached content will be removed after a certain period of months, PopTalk does not provide any means for you to delete the cached content manually.
